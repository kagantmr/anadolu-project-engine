Enemy 1 - Weak Ghost: 

A generic ghost that appears around the village. Aksu usually is mad at them becasue they get too close. They love sticking their tongues out and scaring villagers.

Enemy 2 - Strong Ghost:

This one only appears on incidents and they attack stronger than regular ghosts. To distinguish them from regular ghosts, look at their tongues and eyes.

Enemy 3 - Night Orb:

These appear at night and patrol the mountain roads to hunt humans who get too far. If you're thinking to get a night walk without a weapon... think again.

Enemy 4 - Magic Gear:

These mechanical beasts appear around Hell gates, acting as guards to capture intruders. These also might be made of the spirits assigned to the Hell gate.

Enemy 5 - Cursed Re-animated Arrow:

These arrows are re-animated and they will rain down rapidly near Hell gates, as a guarding mechanism from Hell.

Enemy 6 - Magic Hellfire:

Hellfire inside the City of Hell can soar around and shoot bullets at you. Hellfire moves fast as well!

Enemy 7 - Magma Flash:

Forged from pure magma of Hell, these creatures are dedicated to the task of creating the guardline of the Hell City. They're slow, yet effective.

Enemy 8 - Hell Gear:

Hell Gears are gears forged with lava, making them warm and deadly.

Enemy 9 - Hell's Cannon Bullets:

If you got this far to see Hell Cannon's bullets, good job.
These huge bullets guard the topmost point of Hell while you're climbing at it. Unlike most of the Magma Flashes, they summon a line of bullets too!

Enemy 10 - Cold Sky Stars:

These stars only appear a certain height above Hell. They are probably the last obstacle before your demise.
